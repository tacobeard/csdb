# csdb
A Python driven MySQL database that queries and stores data from the Zendesk API

As of 06/21/2017 the project needs ticket_data.py and insert_csdb.py in the same directory to work.  The files also require a file containing a single Unix timestamp, 'export_time.txt', as well as 'zdcreds.py', containing login credentials as prescribed in the Zenpy documentation.
